Change the default message displayed on pages/posts which are Password Protected.

== Description ==

The easy way to change the message displayed on **Password Protected** posts/pages. For more information please see the setup guide on [this page](https://support.pipdig.co/change-password-protected-message-wordpress/).

By default, WordPress will display a message such as "This content is password protected. Please enter a password to view." when using a Password Protected page. This plugin allows you to override that message for all Password Protected pages, or set a message for a particular page only.

Features:

* Change "This content is password protected. To view it please enter your password below:" to any other text/HTML.
* Display a general message on all password protected posts/pages.
* Display a unique message for a specfic post/page.
* Remove the "Protected" text from the title. So "Protected: Page Title" will show as "Page Title".
* Change the "Password:" input label to any custom text.

There may be some themes which are not compatible with this plugin. If you experience any issues changing the message, please post in the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/change-password-protected-message).
